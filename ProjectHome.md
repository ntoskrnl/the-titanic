<h1>The Titanic</h1>

We are the students of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT). This is our project in informatics.<br>
We want to create a cross-platform billiard game in Java. "TheTitanic" - work name of a project. View <a href='http://code.google.com/p/the-titanic/wiki/SDP'>Software Development Plan</a>

<h2>Description</h2>

The game we want to implement is called "Russian Billiard" (see wikipedia). It is a cross-platform client server application which consists of three parts: server, client, administration tool.<br>
<br>
All parts of a project are written or will be written in Java. We also think to use OpenGL for rendering 3D-scene of the game and provide funny sound. After that we want to create web site where users can register, play online and communicate.<br>
<br>
In the future we are planning to port the application to mobile platforms such as Android. We hope you will love it!<br>
<br>
<h2>The Team</h2>

Our team consists of 3 members:<br>
<ul><li><b>Anton Danshin</b> - Network and game logic<br>
</li><li><b>Artur Gilmullin</b> - Physics<br>
</li><li><b>Alex Kozlovsky</b> - Graphics and interface</li></ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

By the end of current semester (spring 2011) we will implement the folowing features:<br>
<ul><li><b>Dedicated game server</b>, which services the requests from client applications and support a database. The database will contain the information about users and their score.<br>
</li><li><b>Client application</b> will enable the user to see the other ones to play with and will provide to play Russian Billiard in comfortable conditions of friendly user interface.<br>
</li><li><b>3D rendering</b> of the game scene.<br>
</li><li><b>Physical engine</b> will be based on a concept of the impact theory.<br>
</li><li><b>Web-site</b> for registration of users. It will be also used to display current game stats (score, who is online).</li></ul>
